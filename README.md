## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.gyazo.com/9b31e92a01cea85ccf742136b7cc31ee.jpg)

- My demo is live using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the demo can be found [here](https://team-page-dev-challenges.vercel.app/)
- Creating this page wasn't the easiest for me. I had a few things go wrong at the beginning: the positioning of the team cards was quite difficult and the text alignment was a bit of an issue also.
- By creating this site I definitely improved a lot with grid and found new ways to use flexbox.
